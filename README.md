## Install

```bash
npm i https://github.com/nicholaswmin/automap
```

## Usage

This module exports a `repository`:

- `repository.save(object)` saves an object graph
- `repository.fetch({ id: 'foo' })` gets it back

List-like data is detached & saved as a [`Hash`][redis-hash]
or [`List`][redis-list] rather than jam everything into a
single [`Key`][redis-string].  

> Example: A `Building` with `Flats`:

```js
const building = new Building({
  id: 'foo',
  flats: [
    new Flat({ id: 101 }),
    new Flat({ id: 102 })
  ]
})
```

... save it:

```js
import { Repository } from 'automap'

const repo = new Repository(Building, new ioredis())

const building = new Building({
  id: 'foo',
  flats: [
    new Flat({ id: 101 }),
    new Flat({ id: 102 })
  ]
})

await repo.save(building)
```

... saved like so:

```

it rebuilds the entire object graph including *nested* types.

For example:

```js
const building = await repo.fetch({
  id: 'foo'
})

building.flats[0].doorbell()
// üîî at flat: 101 !
```

## Model definition

You can use any object as long as it:

1. it's root has an `id` property set to a unique value
2. can be reconstructed by calling `new` and passing it's JSON

> ‚úÖ  Working example  
> the same `Building` with `Flats` ...

```js
import { List } from 'automap'

class Building {
  constructor({ id, flats = [] }) {
    this.id = id
    this.flats = new List({
      type: Flat,
      from: flats
    })
  }
}

class Flat {
  constructor({ id }) {
    this.id = id
  }

  doorbell() {
    console.log(`üîî at flat: ${this.id}`)
  }
}
```

The above works because:

- The `Building` has an `id` set to a unique value
- The `Building` can be entirely reconstructed by calling
  `new Building(json)` and  passing it's JSON
- The `flats` array is replaced with a `List` type

... but the example below won't work:

```js
class Building {
  // `flats = []` is missing in the
  // constructor arguments
  constructor({ id }) {
    this.id = id
    this.flats = new List({
      type: Flat,
      from: flats
    })
  }
}
```

‚ùå the `Building` root will be constructed OK, but its nested `flats` will not.

the following example won't work either:

```js
class Building {
  // no `id` property
  constructor({ name, flats = [] }) {
    this.name = name
    this.flats = new List({
      type: Flat,
      from: flats
    })
  }
}

const building = new Building({ name: 'bar' })

await repository.save(building)
// throws "error: no id present"
```

‚ùå the root object is missing an `id` property.

## The `List` types

List-like data must use one of the `List` types instead of an [`Array`][array].   
You can still use a regular `Array` but it won't be decomposed from the
main object-graph.

`List`

- fetched with all items loaded
- [linear-time O<sup>n</sup>][linear] additions
- saved as a [`Hash`][redis-hash]

used for lists that must always be loaded to do any work with the object.

[`LazyList`](#lazy-loading)

- fetched empty
- can be loaded with `list.load()`
- [linear-time O<sup>n</sup>][linear] additions
- saved as a [`Hash`][redis-hash]

used for lists that can become "large-ish", yet not always required.

[`AppendList`](#infinite-lists-with-appendlist)

- fetched empty
- can be loaded with `list.load()`
- [constant-time O<sup>1</sup>][const] additions
- saved as a [`List`][redis-list]

used for lists that are way too big to carry around and don't need to be
loaded to do work in most cases.

> Example:

```js
class Building {
  constructor({ id, flats = [] }) {
    this.id = id

    // ! List instead of Array
    this.flats = new List({
      type: Flat,
      from: flats
    })
  }
}
```

All `List` types are subtypes of the native [`Array`][array] and
behave *exactly* the same:

```js

const list = new List({
 from: [1, 2, 3]
})

for (const item of list)
  console.log(item.constructor.name, item)

// Number 1, Number 2 ...

console.log(Array.isArray(list)) // true
```

... you can also specify a `type` parameter to cast to a type:

```js
const list = new List({
 type: String,
 from: [1, 2, 3]
})

for (const item of list)
  console.log(item.constructor.name, item)

// String '1', String '2' ...
```

... and use it like a regular `Array`:

```js
const array = new List(1, 2, 3)

const two = array.find(num => num === 2)

console.log(two)
// 2
```

### Lazy loading

Sometimes you won't need to load the contents of a list initially.   
You might want to load it's contents after you fetch it, or even none at all.

In that case, use a `LazyList` instead of a `List`.

```js
import { LazyList } from 'automap'

class Building {
  constructor({ id, flats = [] }) {
    this.id = id
    this.flats = new LazyList({
      type: Flat,
      from: flats
    })
  }
}
```

... and load its contents by calling `list.load()`:

```js
const building = await repo.fetch({
  id: 'foo'
})

console.log(building.flats)
// [] (empty)

await building.flats.load(repo)

console.log(building.flats)
// [ Flat { id: '101' }, Flat { id: '102' }, ...]
```

### Infinite lists with `AppendList`

Lists with millions of items should use an `AppendList`.

- not loaded on `repository.fetch`
- saves items in a [`List`][redis-list] instead of [`Hash`][redis-hash]

The `repository.save` time of an `AppendList` does not increase in
proportion to the number of items in the list.

Caveats:

- No notion of item deletion. It functions as an [append-only log][append-only],
  hence the name.
- No constant O<sup>1</sup> time lookups for individual list items in Redis.  

An example:

> Each `Flat` has a list of `Mail` items, which can reach millions of items[^2].

```js
import { LazyList } from 'automap'

class Building {
  constructor({ id, flats = [] }) {
    this.id = id
    this.flats = new LazyList({
      type: Flat,
      from: flats
    })
  }
}

class Flat {
  constructor({ id, mail = [] }) {
    this.id = id
    this.mails = new AppendList({
      type: Mail,
      from: mail
    })
  }

  addMail({ id, text }) {
    this.mails.push(new Mail({ id, text }))
  }
}

class Mail {
  constructor({ id, text }) {
    this.id = id
    this.text = text
  }
}
```

### Runnable example

The `Building` example demonstrated above can be [found here][runnable-example].

Run it with:

```bash
npm run example
```

## Redis data structure

All keys saved in Redis follow a canonical and *human-readable* format.

Assuming the above example, the flats are saved under this Redis key:

```
building:foo:flats
```

which is a [Hash][redis-hash] with the following shape:


| Field 	| Value                       	  |
|-------	|-----------------------------	  |
| 101   	| `{"i":0,"json":{"id":"101"}}` 	|
| 102   	| `{"i":1,"json":{"id":"102"}}` 	|
| 103   	| `{"i":2,"json":{"id":"103"}}` 	|


If you need to access an individual flat directly from Redis,
you can simply run:

```
HGET building:foo:flats 101
```

or fetch all the flats:

```
HGETALL building:foo:flats
```

The `Building` itself is saved as:

```
building:foo
```

which you can easily get by:

```
GET building:foo
```

### List items without `id`

List items without an `id` property will use the `index`; their current
position in the list, as the separator.

If the flats didn't have an `id` and they contained a list of `Persons`,
the persons of the 1st flat would be saved under key:

```
building:foo:flats:0:persons
```

## Performance

### Benchmarks

The closest thing to a benchmark is a concurrent load test, available
[here][paper-benchmark].

As a rule of thumb, the `Building` example with `100 Flats` takes about:

- ~ `1.5 ms` to `fetch`
- ~ `3 ms` to `save`

and can handle ~ `300` x `fetch-edit-save` cycles per-second, without creating
a backlog, on a 10 minute sustained-load test.

These results were gathered with the benchmark mentioned above on a popular
cloud-provider with native Redis add-ons and about `20x` concurrency.

### Atomicity

#### Save

- Each list is decomposed into a single Redis `HSET` command.
- All `HSET`s are then packaged into a single [pipelined][pipe] transaction
before being sent down the wire.

Additionally, there's a simple Lua script which allows something akin
to a [`mget`][mget], but for hashes.

These methods ensure updates are both performant and [atomic][atomic][^1].

#### Fetch

In contrast, fetching an object graph is not atomic.  

### Nested Lists

This module allows for an arbitrary amount of nesting of lists, so you can
have a list, inside another list, inside another list and so on...

But you should note the following ...

### Time-complexity

> This section briefly describes the [time-complexity][time] of possible input
> configurations.
>
> Note that in these time-complexity speculations are solely in the context
> of network roundtrips since they are by far the biggest bottleneck in
> most cases.

#### Flat lists

Object graphs which don't have lists nested inside other lists, are fetched
in a process that exhibits an almost
[constant-time complexity O(1)][const].

There's no network roundtrip involved for each list, or even separate requests
since this module uses a small Lua script which allows something akin to
an [`mget`][mget], but for hashes.

#### Nested lists

In contrast, fetching object graphs which have nested lists is a process which
performs in [quadratic-time O(n<sup>2</sup>)][qtc], at a minimum.

Every nesting level increases the exponent by `1` so you can easily jump from
O(n) to O(n<sup>2</sup>) then O(n<sup>3</sup>) and so on.

In short, don't do it.

Also note that a `LazyList` nested in a `List` won't exhibit this  
issue since it doesn't need to be fetched initially.

## Alternatives

### Saving encoded JSONs

... as a [`Redis String`][redis-string].

A small enough object-graph can easily get away with:

- `JSON.stringify(object)`
- `SET building:foo json`
- `GET building:foo`

and `JSON.parse(json)`s

This is a simple, efficient and inherently atomic operation.

The obvious caveat is that you cannot fetch individual list items directly
from Redis since you would always need to fetch and parse the entire graph,
but for (probably most) use-cases that's simply just a non-problem.

### Redis JSON

If [Redis JSON][redis-json] is available then you should use that instead.

Half the issues this module attempts to solve are solved out-the-box
by using Redis JSON directly.

### Alternative modules

[Redis-OM][redisom]

A full-blown object mapper which of course requires schema definitions.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Redis transactions do not assume the same atomicity and isolation
      context that a relational database might assume.
      By every definition they are atomic since they don't allow for
      partial updates, however the entire transaction can fail if client B
      updates a value while it's in the process of being modified by client A
      as part of a transaction.   
      Retries are not currently implemented.

[^2]: The singer "Sting" lives here and gets lots of fan-mail.
      Obviously, this isn't your run-of-the-mill apartment building.
